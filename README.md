AI Views Across the World

## Summary

Our data comes from the UN Human Development Report. More specifically, it is from the 2025 Global Survey on AI and Human Development. The data set contains 21 countries that are separated in 4 categories: “High Human Development Group”, “Low Human Development Group”, “Medium Human Development Groups”, and “Very High Human Development Group”. The data collected for these 21 countries is split up into 6 categories:  
- Demographic section: contains questions like age, gender, education, and occupation  
- AI Interaction section: contains questions like AI interaction frequency, AI use purposes, Internet access, and familiarity with AI  
- Culture and AI Perception section: contains a question about culture and AI perception  
- Agency section: contains questions like current freedom of choice, future freedom of choice, and AI expose and control confidence  
- Social Trust section: contains questions like trust in people, trust in AI systems, and confidence in AI systems  
- Future Expectations section: contains questions like future AI use, and AI impact 

Our research question is focused on understanding how the use of AI differs across different demographic groups and if that is related to the status of the countries that these demographic groups are in. The variables/categories we will use are Demographics, AI interactions, Culture and AI Perception, Social Trust section, Future Expectations, and Human Development. We might want to be looking at AI development in the global south. More specifically, looking at the difference between users of AI and producers (data centers) of AI.  

Our first graph looks at how optimistic different countries are about how AI will affect productivity. Interestingly, it seems that on average, countries with medium development think that AI will help productivity more than countries with very high development. 

Our second graph is showing the average trust in AI systems in comparison to the average trust in people between countries based on their development. It is interesting that the countries with the heighest development trust AI the least and have more trust in people.

Our third graph is showing the average trust in AI systems by country. Countries that have been labelled with lower development scores have higher average trust in AI systems. This can stem from the fact that countries with higher development scores might be more educated on the various miuses of AI which could make them more prudent towards its usage, therefore yielding less trust. 

Our last graph is a map showing the difference of development level with the countries we looked at. Not all countries were covered by the UN survey but we can see a good geographic spread (presence of every continent in the data set).
